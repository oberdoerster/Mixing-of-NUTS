This repository contains the code used to produce Figures 4 and 5 in the paper 'Mixing of the No-U-Turn Sampler and the Geometry of Gaussian Concentration' by Nawaf Bou-Rabee and Stefan Oberd√∂rster.

To reproduce Figure 4, first run nuts_coupling.m followed by plot_orbitfigure.m

To reproduce Figure 5, first run nuts_norm.m followed by plot_indexfigure.m
